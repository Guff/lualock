**lualock** (also known as llock or luaker), may eventually turn out to be a
screenlocker that's highly configurable and extensible with lua.

As it stands right now, however, it's a piece of junk. Doesn't actually do the
screen-locky part yet, but it can be configured to draw a single image onto the
window background.

A-maaaaaazing.
