**lualock** (also known as **llock** or **luaker**), may *eventually* turn out
to be a screenlocker that's highly configurable and extensible with lua.

As it stands right now, however, it's a piece of junk. Although, it does
actually function as a screenlocker now. And it mostly works! The API blows,
however. I'm working on it.

A-maaaaaazing.
