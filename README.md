**lualock** (also known as **llock** or **luaker**), may *eventually* turn out
to be a screenlocker that's highly configurable and extensible with lua.

As it stands right now, however, it's a piece of junk. Although, it does
actually function as a screenlocker now. And it mostly works! The lua bit is
fairly limited currently, only being able to set the background color and
draw background images and other images at arbitrary points on the window.

A-maaaaaazing.
